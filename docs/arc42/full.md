System scope and context
------------------------

Trace-X is an end user application to visualize and utilize data provided to the Catena-X network. This includes the traceability of manufactured parts and batches as well as the shipped and supplied components. To utilize the CX open ecosystem it is necessary to exchange information on serialized parts and batches with supply chain partners in a standardized, data sovereign and interoperable way. This section describes the environment of Trace-X, its intended users and which systems and components it interacts with.

### Business context

Trace-X exchanges data with any other Traceability applications within the CX ecosystem. This is implemented by integrating the service into the CX network and the usage of required central components and services provided by CX.

<img src="architecture-constraints/business-context.svg" width="476" height="450" alt="business context" />

#### User

Trace-X can be deployed, hosted and run by every party that is part of the Catena-X network. They need to be registered, have a BPN, technical user as well as provide valid credentials. An end-user in Trace-X can have roles provided by the CX Portal (User, Supervisor, Admin). As a prerequisite for Trace-X, valid data must already be provided to CX network since Trace-X only consumes data but has no import interface or data provisioning functionality.

#### IRS

Item Relationship Service is the component that is used by Trace-X to fetch the data chains from Catena-X network. Data that is provided by IRS gets extracted, aggregated, transformed and is used for further actions in Trace-X. Further information can be found in the [IRS architecture documentation (arc42)](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/item-relationship-service/docs/arc42/).

#### Catena-X network

Trace-X and IRS are retrieving necessary information and data from the Catena-X network (Users, digital twins, aspects, submodels, Business Partner information). If CX services are unavailable, Trace-X will not be able to perform most of its work.

#### Any other Traceability App

Trace-X interacts with any other Traceability app using the CX standards. This enables sovereign data exchange as well as receiving and sending notifications to interact between different parties.

### Technology

Trace-X is developed using Java and the Spring Boot framework for the Backend and Typescript based on the Angular framework for the Frontend. This decision was taken due to the support of the frameworks as well as technical knowledge of the team members.

The application can be hosted using Docker and Kubernetes. This is commonly used and widespread. With this the application has no vendor lock in regarding the hosting provider.

The communication between Frontend and Backend is done using REST APIs. This is the standard method in the Catena-X landscape and makes the application components easy to use for any third party client.

As the database to store parts information etc. PostgreSQL Database is used.

### Structure

Trace-X is divided into two components: Frontend and Backend.
It roughly can be broken down into the following parts:

-   Asset controller to get the asset information

-   Dashboard controller to get dashboard related summed up information

-   Registry controller to fetch assets from the Digital Twin Registry

-   Registry lookup metrics controller to set parameters to the Registry lookup

The backend does a request to the Digital Twin Registry utilizing the Registry controller and Registry lookup metrics. Extracted data from the response is made available through the Asset controller and the Dashboard controller to the Frontend.

#### Component description

|Components |Description
|IRS
|The IRS consumes relationship information across the CX-Network and builds the graph view. Within this Documentation, the focus lies on the IRS

|EDC Consumer
|The EDC Consumer Component is there to fulfill the GAIA-X and IDSA-data sovereignty principles. The EDC Consumer consists out of a control plane and a data plane.

|EDC Provider
|The EDC Provider Component connects with EDC Consumer component and  forms the end point for the actual exchange of data. It handles automatic contract negotiation and the subsequent exchange of data assets for connected applications.

|Submodel Server
|The Submodel Server offers endpoints for requesting the Submodel aspects.

|IAM/DAPS
|DAPS as central Identity Provider

Quality requirements
--------------------

This section includes concrete quality scenarios to better capture the key quality objectives but also other required quality attributes.

### Quality tree

The tree structure provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

<img src="architecture-constraints/business-context.svg" width="535" height="272" alt="business context" />

### Quality scenarios

The initial letters of the scenario identifiers (IDs) in the following table each stand for the higher-level quality characteristic. For example M for maintainability. These identifiers are also used in the quality tree. The scenarios cannot always be clearly assigned to a characteristic. Therefore, they sometimes appear more than once in the quality tree.
